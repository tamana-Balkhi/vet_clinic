# Vet Clinic Database
 a databasefor a Vet Clinic, stored data such as animals' name, birth of date, and more. Here we can query the information as well.

## Getting Started
This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql]() to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql]() to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql]() for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!
